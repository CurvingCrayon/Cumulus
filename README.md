Note consolidation softawre.

This is a major project for the Software Design and Development course by Hayden Keers.

The main purpose of the software is to consolidate notes from the 3 most major cloud storage services: Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox.
The software will be designed to help both students and teachers alike organise their notes, and be able to keep them all in one location.

This software is being developed under an Open Source License, and is therefore free for anyone to modify and re-release under the same license.
